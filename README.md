a personal blog built using :
php (Laravel),
Javascript,
Tailwind CSS ,
i mostly use Mysql for my databases management but in this project i used sqlite to make the project easier to upload in github,
i used Tailwind authentication for users registery and login,
to run the project on the local server you have to download node js and php then run in terminal :
npm i 
npm run watch
php artisan serve
